pbproxy [-l port] -k keyfile destination port

  -l  Reverse-proxy mode: listen for inbound connections on <port> and relay
      them to <destination>:<port>

  -k  Use the symmetric key contained in <keyfile> (as a hexadecimal string)

Implementation details : 

1. Parsing command line arguments using getopt. 
2. Client reads from STDIN, encrypts the data using aes in ctr mode and sends it to pbproxy server. 
3. Client reads on socket connection with pbproxy server for receiving encrypted responses. 
4. Pbproxy server accepts client connection, connects to ssh, sets sockets to non blocking using fcntl for IO multiplexing.
5. Pbproxy server listens at client socket, decrypts received data and sends it to ssh socket.
6. Pbproxy server receives data at ssh socket, encrypts it and sends it to client.
7. Pbproxy listens for new client connections once established client disconnects.
